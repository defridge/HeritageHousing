    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we achieved the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "- Cleaned the main and inherited house datasets by handling missing values and performing feature engineering (like creating the TotalSF feature).\n",
    "- Encoded categorical variables to numerical formats for use in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Building and Evaluation:**\n",
    "- Trained three models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.\n",
    "- Evaluated all models using R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE) on both training and testing datasets.\n",
    "- Generated predictions for Lydia’s inherited houses using all three models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Model Comparison:**\n",
    "- XGBoost outperformed the other models with the highest R² score on both training (0.999) and testing (0.897) sets, and the lowest MSE on the testing set.\n",
    "- Random Forest also performed well but had a slightly lower R² score on the testing set (0.887).\n",
    "- Linear Regression had the lowest performance in terms of R² and MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Model Selection:**\n",
    "Based on the comparison of models, **XGBoost** was selected as the best-performing model, as it generalizes well and provides the highest prediction accuracy for house prices. This model was saved for future use.\n",
